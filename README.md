## Cancer Classification Using Decision Tree Classifier

Objective:

To develop and visualize a Decision Tree classifier for accurately predicting and classifying cancer based on key diagnostic features.

Description:
1. Data Utilization: Leverage diagnostic features such as mean radius, texture, and area to predict cancer classification.
2. Model Implementation: Implement a Decision Tree classifier to distinguish between benign and malignant cancer types.
3. Visualization: Provide a clear, visual representation of the decision-making process using tree diagrams.
4. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
5. Interpretability: Enhance model interpretability by showcasing how each feature contributes to the final prediction.
